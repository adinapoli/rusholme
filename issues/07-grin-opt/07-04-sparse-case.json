    "body": "Implement sparse case optimisation: remove case alternatives for tags that HPT proves can never appear at the scrutinee.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Analyse each `case` expression: which tags can the scrutinee actually have? (from HPT)\n- Remove alternatives for impossible tags\n- If only one alternative remains, replace `case` with the alternative body (with appropriate bindings)\n- Unit tests\n\n**Design notes:**\n- Often combined with evaluated case elimination\n- Reduces code size and can enable further optimisations",
