    "body": "Implement dead code and dead data elimination using HPT results.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Remove unreachable function definitions (not called from `main`)\n- Remove unused variables (bound but never referenced)\n- Remove dead constructor fields (fields that are never `fetch`ed)\n- Remove unused case alternatives (tags that HPT proves can never appear)\n- Preserve program semantics (don't remove side-effecting code)\n- Unit tests showing code size reduction\n\n**Design notes:**\n- This is the first optimisation pass to implement \u2014 highest impact per effort\n- GRIN's whole-program nature makes this more effective than per-module DCE\n- Dead data field elimination is unique to GRIN \u2014 it can remove individual fields from constructors",
