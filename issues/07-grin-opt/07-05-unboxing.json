    "body": "Implement unboxing: when a value is always a single-constructor type with one field, eliminate the constructor wrapper.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Identify variables/returns that HPT shows are always a single constructor with one field (e.g. `CInt n`)\n- Replace the boxed representation with the raw unboxed value\n- Update all `store`/`fetch`/`case` operations accordingly\n- Handle function parameters and return values that can be unboxed\n- Unit tests showing unboxing applied to `Int`, `Char`, and `newtype` wrappers\n\n**Design notes:**\n- This is a major performance optimisation \u2014 avoids heap allocation for simple values\n- GHC does this via worker-wrapper; GRIN does it as a GRIN-to-GRIN transformation\n- Must be careful with polymorphic code where the type isn't known to be single-constructor",
