    "body": "Extend the type inference engine with type class support and implement dictionary-passing translation.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Class environment: store class declarations (superclasses, methods, default methods)\n- Instance environment: store instance declarations\n- Constraint solving: given `Eq a` constraint, find the right instance\n- Dictionary-passing translation: translate type class constraints into explicit dictionary arguments in Core\n  - `show x` where `x :: a, Show a` becomes `show showDict x`\n- Handle superclass constraints: `Ord a` implies `Eq a`\n- Emit diagnostics for: missing instances, ambiguous types, overlapping instances\n- Unit tests for class resolution and dictionary translation\n\n**Design notes:**\n- This is the standard Wadler-Blott dictionary-passing approach\n- Single-parameter type classes only for now\n- Stock deriving (Show, Eq, Ord, Read) generates instance declarations in the desugarer (05-05)",
