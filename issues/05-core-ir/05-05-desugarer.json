    "body": "Implement the desugarer that translates the typed Haskell AST into Core.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Translate function bindings into Core lambdas and case expressions\n- Desugar pattern matching:\n  - Multiple equations \u2192 case tree\n  - Guards \u2192 nested if/case\n  - `where` clauses \u2192 let bindings\n- Desugar `if/then/else` \u2192 `case`\n- Desugar `do`-notation \u2192 monadic bind/then chains\n- Desugar operator sections \u2192 lambdas\n- Desugar tuple/list syntax \u2192 constructor application\n- Desugar `deriving` clauses \u2192 generated instance method implementations\n- Desugar negation \u2192 `negate` application\n- Generate stock deriving instances for `Show`, `Eq`, `Ord`, `Read`\n- Unit tests comparing desugared Core output against expected Core\n\n**Design notes:**\n- Pattern match compilation is a well-studied problem. Reference: 'The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages', Peyton Jones 1987, Chapter 5\n- The desugarer is where most Haskell syntactic sugar is eliminated\n- For M1 (`main = putStrLn \"Hello\"`): only simple bindings and application need to work",
