    "body": "Implement full pattern parsing for function arguments, case alternatives, and let bindings.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Variable patterns: `x`\n- Constructor patterns: `Just x`, `Left (Right y)`\n- Literal patterns: `0`, `'a'`, `\"hello\"`\n- Wildcard: `_`\n- As-patterns: `xs@(x:rest)`\n- Tuple patterns: `(a, b, c)`\n- List patterns: `[x, y]`, `(x:xs)`\n- Negated literal patterns: `-1`\n- Parenthesised patterns\n- Infix constructor patterns: `x : xs`\n- Nested patterns (arbitrary depth)\n- Unit tests including deeply nested and edge-case patterns\n\n**Design notes:**\n- Patterns and expressions share some syntax (constructors, literals, tuples) \u2014 may share some parsing code\n- Guards are parsed as part of function equations, not patterns themselves",
