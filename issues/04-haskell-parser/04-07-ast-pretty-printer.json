    "body": "Implement a pretty-printer for the Haskell AST, used for debugging and golden test output.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- `prettyPrint(ast) -> []const u8` that produces readable, indented output for any AST node\n- Output should be deterministic (suitable for golden test comparison)\n- Round-trip friendly where possible: printing a parsed AST should produce valid Haskell (modulo comments)\n- Unit tests comparing pretty-printed output against expected strings\n\n**Design notes:**\n- This is essential for debugging the parser and for golden tests\n- Consider a tree-dump mode (showing node types) vs a Haskell-source mode (showing valid Haskell)\n- Use Zig's `std.fmt` / writer interface for output",
