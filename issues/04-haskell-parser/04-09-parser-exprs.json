    "body": "Implement expression parsing for primary constructs and control flow, leveraging the precedence parser.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- `let ... in ...`\n- `case expr of { alts }`\n- `if ... then ... else ...`\n- `do` notation (statement sequence: bind `<-`, let, plain expr)\n- Lambda: `\\x y -> expr`\n- Tuple expressions and sections\n- List expressions: `[1, 2, 3]`\n- Unit tests for control flow constructs and their interaction with layout\n\n**Design notes:**\n- Must handle the high precedence of function application correctly.\n- Interaction with layout in `do` and `let` blocks is critical.",
