    "body": "Define the basic Prelude types as built-in or Haskell source that the compiler knows about.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- `Bool` = `True | False`\n- `Int` (machine-width integer, backed by a primop)\n- `Char` (Unicode code point)\n- `String` = `[Char]`\n- `Maybe a` = `Nothing | Just a`\n- `Either a b` = `Left a | Right b`\n- `IO a` (abstract, backed by runtime primitives)\n- List type `[a]` = `[] | a : [a]`\n- Tuple types `(a, b)`, `(a, b, c)` etc.\n- `()` unit type\n- `Ordering` = `LT | EQ | GT`\n- These can be defined in Haskell source (`Prelude.hs`) or wired-in to the compiler (or a mix)\n- Unit tests verifying the types are available to user programs\n\n**Design notes:**\n- `Int` and `Char` are special: they need compiler/runtime support for unboxed representation\n- `IO` is special: it threads `RealWorld` tokens\n- Consider: Prelude as Haskell source that Rusholme compiles, vs hard-coded in the compiler",
