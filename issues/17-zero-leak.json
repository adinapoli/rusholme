    "body": "Establish tooling and policy to ensure the Rusholme compiler has zero memory leaks. Zig's manual memory management means every allocation must be paired with a deallocation. This epic sets up the enforcement mechanisms:\n\n1. Research the best leak detection strategy for Zig + C interop\n2. Enforce std.testing.allocator usage in all tests\n3. Add GPA leak detection to main.zig for debug builds\n4. Add Valgrind CI step for C interop (deferred until LLVM backend is active)\n5. Document the zero-leak policy\n\n**Key principle:** No PR may be merged if it introduces a memory leak. Tests using std.testing.allocator catch this automatically.\n\n**Sub-tasks:** #107, #108, #109, #110",
