    "body": "Implement the Immix allocator's block/line structure and bump-pointer allocation.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- `ImmixBlock` (32KB): subdivided into 128-byte lines\n- Block allocator: request blocks from the OS (`std.heap.page_allocator` or `mmap`)\n- Bump-pointer allocation within the current block\n- Overflow handling: when current block is full, get a new block\n- Line-granularity metadata: mark lines as used/free\n- Implement as a Zig `std.mem.Allocator` (provide `alloc`, `resize`, `free` vtable)\n- Unit tests: allocate many small objects, verify they're in the right blocks/lines\n\n**Design notes:**\n- Reference: Blackburn & McKinley, PLDI 2008 (see docs/references/immix-gc.md)\n- 32KB blocks, 128B lines is the standard Immix configuration\n- Bump-pointer allocation is fast \u2014 similar to GHC's nursery allocation\n- Don't implement collection yet (14-03); this issue is allocation only",
