    "body": "Add a CI step that runs end-to-end tests under Valgrind to catch memory leaks in C library code (primarily LLVM C API bindings).\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Add Valgrind to the Nix flake dev dependencies\n- Create a Valgrind suppression file for known LLVM/system library noise\n- Add a GitHub Actions CI step that runs tests under Valgrind\n- Document how to run Valgrind locally in CONTRIBUTING.md\n\n**Design notes:**\n- This is deferred until the LLVM backend (#53, #54, #55) is actively exercised in tests\n- Zig's std.testing.allocator cannot see leaks inside C libraries\n- Valgrind needs code built with std.heap.c_allocator for full visibility\n- Consider running Valgrind on a subset of tests (e.g. end-to-end only) to limit CI time\n- May need -mcpu=baseline for Valgrind compatibility on AVX-512 systems",
