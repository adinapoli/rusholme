Add GeneralPurposeAllocator with .deinit() leak check to main.zig for debug builds.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Audit all test blocks across the codebase for allocator usage\n- Fix any tests not using std.testing.allocator (audit shows none currently, but verify)\n- Add GPA with .deinit() == .ok assertion to main.zig entry point (debug builds only)\n- Ensure zig build test passes with zero leaks\n\n**Design notes:**\n- Current audit shows 100% compliance — all heap-allocating tests use std.testing.allocator\n- main.zig should use GeneralPurposeAllocator in debug builds, with deinit check at exit\n- This ensures leaks are caught both in tests AND during manual development runs\n- ArenaAllocator wrapping std.testing.allocator is acceptable (the parent allocator still detects leaks)",
