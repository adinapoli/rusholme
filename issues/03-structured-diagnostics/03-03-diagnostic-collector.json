    "body": "Implement a collector that accumulates diagnostics from all modules, rather than stopping at the first error.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- `DiagnosticCollector` struct that stores a list of `Diagnostic`\n- `emit(diagnostic)` to add a diagnostic\n- `hasErrors() bool` \u2014 true if any `Error`-severity diagnostic exists\n- `diagnostics()` \u2014 return all collected diagnostics, sorted by source location\n- Thread-safety consideration: for now single-threaded is fine, but document where locking would be needed\n- Unit tests\n\n**Design notes:**\n- GHC stops at first module error; Rusholme should collect across all modules (DESIGN.md goal)\n- The collector will be threaded through all pipeline stages\n- Consider using Zig's `ArrayList` internally",
