    "body": "Enhance the terminal diagnostic renderer to include high-quality source code snippets.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- `renderSnippet(span: SourceSpan)` helper\n- Include line numbers on the left\n- Highlight the exact span with carets `^` or underlining\n- Show context lines (1-2 lines before and after the affected line)\n- Support multi-line spans correctly\n- Use ANSI colors for severity and highlights (leveraging a dedicated `color.zig` or similar)\n\n**Design notes:**\n- Efficiency is important: don't re-read the whole file for every diagnostic; use a file buffer cache if needed.\n- Must handle tab expansion or at least be consistent with how the lexer tracks columns.",
