    "body": "Build an end-to-end test runner that compiles a Haskell program, executes the resulting binary, and checks stdout against expected output.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Extend the golden test runner (or create a separate mode) for e2e tests\n- Directory structure: `tests/e2e/<test-name>/<test-name>.hs` + `.stdout`\n- The runner compiles the `.hs` file to a binary (or runs via interpreter), executes it, and compares stdout to `.stdout`\n- Support for expected exit codes and stderr checking\n- A placeholder test (e.g. `hello.hs` with `main = putStrLn \"Hello\"`) ready for when M1 is complete\n\n**Design notes:**\n- This won't be runnable until the pipeline can actually produce executables or the interpreter works\n- But the infrastructure should be ready so tests can be added incrementally",
