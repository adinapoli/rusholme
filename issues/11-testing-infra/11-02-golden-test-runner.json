    "body": "Build a golden test runner that compiles Haskell snippets through the pipeline and compares output against expected results.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- A test runner (Zig code or shell script invoked by `zig build`) that:\n  1. Reads `.hs` files from a `tests/golden/` directory\n  2. Runs them through the Rusholme pipeline (whichever stages exist)\n  3. Compares output against a `.expected` file\n  4. Reports pass/fail with diffs on failure\n- Support for updating expected files (`--update` or `--accept` flag)\n- Directory structure: `tests/golden/<test-name>/<test-name>.hs` + `.expected`\n- A few placeholder test cases (can be empty/trivial until pipeline stages exist)\n\n**Design notes:**\n- GHC's testsuite uses a similar approach; we're keeping it simpler\n- Golden tests will be the primary integration testing mechanism\n- The runner should support testing different pipeline stages (e.g. `--stage=parse` to test parser output)",
