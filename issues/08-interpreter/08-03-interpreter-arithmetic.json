    "body": "Add arithmetic and comparison primitive operations to the GRIN interpreter.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- Integer arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `div`, `mod`, `negate`\n- Integer comparison: `==`, `/=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`\n- Char operations: `ord`, `chr`\n- Boolean representation and operations\n- String operations: cons, head, tail, null (for `[Char]` representation)\n- Unit tests for each primitive\n\n**Design notes:**\n- These are 'primops' \u2014 built-in functions that the interpreter handles specially\n- In GRIN, these appear as calls to known primitive function names\n- Keep the primop set small and well-defined; match what the Prelude needs",
